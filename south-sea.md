# The South Sea Dragon Palace

You soar through the ocean currents toward the South Sea. The waters here churn with unnatural fury as you approach Ao Qin's Crystal Palace.

The possessed Dragon King awaits you, his eyes glowing with malevolent energy. Dark clouds swirl around him as he prepares to summon a catastrophic flood.

"Brother Ao Guang sent you?" Ao Qin laughs, his voice distorted by the evil spirit within. "Even the Great Sage Equal to Heaven cannot stop me now!"

You remember the lessons from your Master, Tang Sanzang. Sometimes strength alone is not enough—wisdom and compassion can triumph where brute force fails.
