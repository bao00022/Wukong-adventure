# The Legend of the Monkey King: The Four Trials

You are Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equal to Heaven. You possess 72 transformations, a magical Golden Staff that weighs 17,500 pounds, and a cloud that carries you across the sky.

Currently, you are on a sacred mission to protect the Monk, Tang Sanzang, on a journey to the Western Heaven. However, the path is filled with ancient demons and celestial challenges that test your strength, wisdom, and loyalty.

You stand at a mystical crossroads. Four distorted paths lie before you, each leading to a legendary battle from your past or future. The air is heavy with magic, and your Master is waiting for your guidance.
