# Trial One: The White Bone Demon

A pale mist drifts between the bamboo stalks like silk pulled through cold fingers. Your steps make no sound, but the forest listens anyway.

Ahead, a **young girl** appears on the path, carrying a basket of steamed buns and fruit. Her eyes are gentle. Her voice is soft.

Your Master’s stomach growls. Tang Sanzang begins to step forward, grateful for kindness in a dangerous world.

But your **Golden Gaze** pierces the illusion.

Beneath her skin is not warmth or blood—only bone.

A skeletal spirit wears a human face.

If you strike now, your Master may call you cruel, even murderous.  
If you hesitate, the demon will feast on him the moment your guard drops.

**What do you do?**
