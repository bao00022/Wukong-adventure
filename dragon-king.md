# The Dragon King's Palace

You dive beneath the waves of the Eastern Sea, descending into the depths where sunlight cannot reach. The water parts before you as you approach the magnificent Crystal Palace of Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the Eastern Sea.

The palace gates swing open, and shimmering fish guards bow as you enter. Inside, the Dragon King sits upon his coral throne, his long whiskers flowing like rivers of silver.

"Sun Wukong!" Ao Guang exclaims, his voice echoing through the watery halls. "What brings the Great Sage to my domain?"

You remember this place well. It was here that you claimed your legendary Ruyi Jingu Bang, the Golden-Banded Staff, from the Dragon King's treasury. But today, something feels different. The palace guards seem nervous, and whispers flow through the court like currents.

"A dark force stirs in the depths," the Dragon King confesses, his eyes filled with worry. "My brother, Ao Qin of the South Sea, has been possessed by a vengeful spirit. He now threatens to unleash a great flood upon the mortal realm. You owe me a debt, Monkey King—you took my treasured staff and my golden chain mail. Will you help me now?"

You twirl your Golden Staff, ready for action. The fate of the mortal world hangs in the balance.
